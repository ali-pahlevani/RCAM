## Abstract
In this project, the main goal, is math modeling a 6 degrees of freedom conventional aircraft (RCAM). When the modeling process is done, trimming process of the aircraft about different trim points starts. Trimming is done in either steady or unsteady state mode. Then, process of linearizing the model about the trimming points starts. When the linearizing process is complete, the process of linear controlling of the aircraft is initiated. Three methods of control is used for linear controlling process: State Feedback, PID and an adaptive control approach rising from the gain scheduling method. In the next step, the characteristic equations of the aircraft in both longitudinal and lateral-directional channels are studied and finally, some nonlinear controlling method that could be used in this project are checked out. At the end of each chapter, a simulation of the same chapter in the MATLAB and Simulink environment is displayed and in the final chapter, a general conclusion will be made and the results will be reviewed.
